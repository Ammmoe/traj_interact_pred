# Drone Interaction Classification (Dual-Encoder Bi-GRU)

This repository provides a **training pipeline** for classifying drone interaction types using a **dual-encoder Bi-GRU architecture**. The system processes multi-agent trajectory data and predicts interaction labels between agent pairs.

## ⚙️ Model Architecture

### 🔷 Attention-Enhanced Dual-Encoder Classifier (Full Model Overview)

Two Bi-GRU encoders independently generate embeddings for each agent type.  
A Cross-Agent Self-Attention Transformer captures interactions between agent embeddings, followed by an MLP classifier to predict interaction types.

### 🔷 Bi-GRU Encoder (Per-Agent Trajectory Encoder)

Each encoder processes a sequence of agent states (e.g., position, velocity) using a **Bi-directional GRU**.  
The final forward and backward hidden states are concatenated and projected into a fixed-size embedding vector.

## 🧱 Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a conda environment.

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment you are using
conda activate your_env

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)
git lfs install

# Pull large files tracked by Git LFS (e.g., datasets)
git lfs pull
```

---

## 🔁 Training (`train.py`)

The training pipeline:

1. Loads trajectory and relationship datasets from CSV files
2. Generates agent-pair samples
3. Extracts embeddings using a **Bi-GRU encoder** for each agent
4. Feeds the embeddings into a **dual-encoder classifier**
5. Trains with validation monitoring and optional early stopping
6. Saves:
   - `best_model.pt`
   - `last_model.pt`
   - `checkpoint.pt`
   - `config.json`
   - `train.log`
7. Performs final test-set evaluation

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key parameters inside `train.py`:

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 32     # Number of samples per training batch
EPOCHS = 50         # Total training iterations over the full dataset
LR = 1e-3           # Learning rate for the optimizer
VAL_SPLIT = 0.15    # Percentage of data reserved for validation during training
TEST_SPLIT = 0.15   # Percentage of data reserved for final testing
MAX_AGENTS = 6      # Maximum number of agents considered per sample for interaction prediction
LOOKBACK = 50       # Number of past trajectory timesteps used to classify interactions
```

Encoder parameters:

```python
encoder_params = {
    "input_size": 6,
    "enc_hidden_size": 64,
    "embedding_dim": 64,
    "num_layers": 1,
}
```

---

## ▶️ Running Training

To start a new training run:

```bash
python -m scripts.train
```

A new folder is automatically created inside `experiments/`:

```bash
experiments/20251120_103050/
```

This folder contains all saved models, logs, and configuration files for that run.

---

## 🔁 Resuming Training

To resume training from a previous experiment checkpoint, set in `train.py`:

```python
RESUME_TRAINING = True
exp_dir = "experiments/20251119_184413"
RESUME_CHECKPOINT = os.path.join(exp_dir, "checkpoint.pt")
```

This restores:

- Model weights
- Optimizer state
- Epoch number
- Training progress

Training continues automatically from the saved checkpoint.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

After training completes, the script:

- Evaluates on the test set
- Computes classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Logs results to `training.log`
- Stores experiment configurations in `config.json`

All outputs are saved inside the experiment folder.

---

## 🔍 Inference

### ⚙️ Inference Configuration

The inference script provides two optional parameters for simulating scenarios with missing agents:

- num_friendly_to_pad: Number of friendly agents to zero-pad during inference.
- num_unauth_to_pad: Number of unauthorized agents to zero-pad.

> Padding is applied by randomly selecting which agents to suppress, similar to the training-time padding strategy.

---

### **Examples:**

- Pad 2 friendly agents and 2 unauthorized agents:

```python
num_friendly_to_pad = 2  
num_unauth_to_pad = 2
```

- Do not pad any agents:

```python
num_friendly_to_pad = 0  
num_unauth_to_pad = 0
```

---

### ▶️ Running Inference (`inference.py`)

Run inference with:

```bash
python -m scripts.inference
```

---

## 🚁 Running the Simulation Agent

The simulation agent runs a trajectory tracking and interaction prediction loop using the trained dual-encoder Bi-GRU model.

### ▶️ Command to Run

```python
python -m traj_interact_predict.simulation.sim_agent
```

### 📝 What It Does

- Initializes the simulation agent  
- Tracks and generates trajectories of multiple agents  
- Uses the trained interaction classifier to predict interaction pairs between friendly and unauthorized agents  
- Prints out predicted interaction pairs with their confidence labels
